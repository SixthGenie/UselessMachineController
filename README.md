# UselessMachineController
This is the behavior editor for my Useless Machine. Use it to design behavior and download to EEPROM of the Arduino controlling the Useless Machine.

It tries to mimick the actions and look of my specific box, and can be used to simulate how the box will behave by running the sequences defined just as the Arduino would.

The program is nowhere feature complete, and is a quick-and-dirty solution; but it demonstrates how to take the idea of a Useless Machine a bit further.
